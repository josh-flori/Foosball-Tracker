# Foosball-Tracker

We have a Foosball table at work. Often, there are extraordinary plays that we would like to record and play back later. And we would also like to track stats like: 
"was this the highest scoring game?" and 
"was this the longest game?" and 
"was this the longest we have ever gone before scoring a point?" and 
"who has the most shots on goal? etc…
Using the google vision kit and google voice kit, we can create a smart unit to track all of those stats as well as use a speaker to interact with and announce important events to the players in real time.
